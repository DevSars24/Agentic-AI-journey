# 🧠 Agentic AI – Notes

## 🔑 Definition

👉 **Agentic AI** is an AI system that can **take a task/goal from a user and autonomously work towards completing it with minimal human guidance**, asking for help only when necessary.
👉 It acts as a **proactive assistant** that handles tasks **on your behalf** in real-world scenarios.

## ✅ How to Identify an Agentic AI Chatbot

| Feature                  | Meaning                               | Example                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 🤖 **Autonomous**        | Takes decisions/actions itself        | Monitors your work, sends reminders, applies fixes |
| 🎯 **Goal-Oriented**     | Works strictly toward achieving goals | Hiring a backend engineer                          |
| 🗺️ **Planning**         | Generates step-by-step plans          | Posting job ads, scheduling interviews             |
| 🧩 **Reasoning**         | Makes logical decisions & adapts      | Choosing cheapest + fastest hiring plan            |
| 🔄 **Adaptability**      | Adjusts to failures & feedback        | Switches to freelancer if no full-time candidates  |
| 🧠 **Context Awareness** | Uses memory & environment info        | Remembers your company name, preferences           |

## 🏗️ Core Abilities of Autonomy

* ⚡ **Execution** → runs tasks end-to-end
* 🧭 **Decision Making** → chooses best option among alternatives
* 🔧 **Tool Usage** → calls APIs, databases, schedulers

⚠️ **Autonomy can be dangerous** if uncontrolled:

* ❌ Bias / Discrimination
* ❌ Sending wrong salaries or job offers
* ❌ Violating policies

---

## 🔐 Controlling Autonomy

* 📌 **Permission Scope** → restrict allowed actions
* 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** → confirm decisions if risky
* ⛔ **Override Controls** → admin stop/pause
* 🛡️ **Guardrails/Policies** → ethical + compliance rules

---

## 🎯 Goal-Oriented Behavior

* All actions are **directed to the defined goal**.
* Goals can have **constraints** (budget, time, skills, etc.).
* Goals are stored in **core memory**.

📄 **Example: Goal in JSON**

```json
{
  "goal": "Hire backend engineer",
  "techstack": "Node.js, MongoDB",
  "experience": "3+ years",
  "remote": true,
  "status": "In Progress",
  "created_at": "2025-09-05",
  "progress": ["JD created", "Applications received", "Interviews scheduled"]
}
```

---

## 🗺️ Planning

Agentic AI → generates **multiple candidate plans** and selects the best.

### Example: Hiring Backend Engineer

🔹 Plans generated:

* Post JD on LinkedIn, GitHub Jobs, AngelList
* Use internal referrals
* Contact hiring agencies

🔹 Evaluation factors:

* ⚡ Efficiency
* 🔧 Tool Availability
* 💰 Cost
* ⚠ Risk
* 🎯 Alignment with constraints

✅ Final Plan chosen → guided by **pre-programmed policy**

---

## 🧩 Reasoning

Reasoning is the **cognitive process** where Agentic AI:

* Interprets info
* Draws conclusions
* Makes decisions (planning + execution)

⚙️ **Steps**:

1. Goal Decomposition
2. Tool Selection
3. Resource Allocation
4. Error Handling / HITL

---

## 🔄 Adaptability

Agentic AI adapts to:

* ❌ Failures (e.g., Calendar API down → use email instead)
* 📉 Feedback (few applications → post in more portals)
* 🔁 Changing Goals (switch from full-time to freelancer hiring)

---

## 🧠 Context Awareness

Ability to **understand, retain, and use relevant info** across tasks.

### Sources of Context

* Original Goal
* Progress till now
* Environment state (tools available, time constraints)
* Tool responses (API errors, confirmations)
* User preferences
* Policies & guardrails

### 🧠 Memory Types

* 📝 **Short-Term Memory** → session-based (current chat/task)
* 📂 **Long-Term Memory** → persistent (user’s name, past goals, preferences)

| Component            | Function                                                                | Example / Tools                        |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 🧠 **Brain (LLM)**   | Goal interpretation, planning, reasoning, tool selection, communication | GPT, Claude, Gemini                    |
| 🎛️ **Orchestrator** | Executes plan: task sequencing, retries, loops, delegation              | LangGraph, CrewAI                      |
| 🧰 **Tools**         | APIs, databases, external actions                                       | Calendar API, LinkedIn API, RAG search |
| 📝 **Memory**        | Stores context: short-term, long-term, state tracking                   | Vector DB (Pinecone, Weaviate)         |
| 👨‍⚖️ **Supervisor** | Human-in-the-Loop, edge case handling, override controls                | Review UI, alert system                |
