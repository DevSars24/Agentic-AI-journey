# LLM Workflow → Graph (LangGraph concepts)

**Short summary:**
A *graph-based LLM workflow* models a complex application as a directed graph where **each node is a task** (often an LLM call, a tool invocation, or a small computation), edges define execution order (sequential, parallel, conditional, loop), and a shared **state** (key → value) flows between nodes. This structure makes building agentic, scalable, and production-ready LLM applications much easier to reason about and implement.

---

# 1. Core ideas (simple)

* **Node = single task.** Example: call an LLM with a prompt, call a search API, run a classifier, or send an email.
* **Edge = execution relation.** Edges tell which node runs after/with which other nodes. Two main flavors:

  * **Sequential edge** (A → B): A finishes then B runs.
  * **Parallel edge** (A ─┬→ B and A ─┬→ C): run B and C concurrently and merge results.
* **Graph trigger**: you provide an initial input to the first node (or an initial state) and invoke the graph.
* **State**: a shared key-value dictionary that carries data across nodes. Every node can read (and typically update) the state.

---

# 2. Why graph-based workflows?

* **Modularity**: split big tasks into small, testable nodes.
* **Parallelism**: run independent subtasks concurrently and merge results for speed.
* **Routing & Decisioning**: route tasks to different LLMs/agents depending on inputs.
* **Reusability**: reuse nodes across workflows (e.g., a `summarize` node).
* **Observability & Retry**: easier to monitor, retry failed nodes, or scale particular nodes.

---

# 3. Key terms (quick glossary)

* **LLM\_CALL**: Node that sends a prompt to an LLM and writes result to state.
* **PROMPT CHAIN**: Sequential LLM calls where later calls use earlier outputs.
* **ROUTER**: A decision node that chooses which downstream path to take (could be an LLM or simple rule).
* **ORCHESTRATOR**: Higher-level controller that spawns parallel tasks and collects results.
* **AGGREGATOR**: Node that merges parallel results into a final form (merge lists, choose best, voting).
* **EVALUATOR**: Node that scores or validates outputs (used for selection or feedback).
* **REDUCER**: Rules that define *how state updates are applied* (append vs replace vs merge).
* **STATE**: The shared key-value store that threads through the graph.

# 4. Node types & simple explanation

### LLM Call / Generator Node

* **Purpose:** Generate text, extract entities, classify content, or produce prompts for other nodes.
* **Example:** `generate_email_draft` reads `state.user_info` and writes `state.email_draft`.

### Router Node (Decision-maker)

* **Purpose:** Decide which downstream node/path to run.
* **Example:** `route_to_expert` checks `state.topic` and routes to `legal_agent` or `code_agent`.

### Orchestrator / Parallel Spawner

* **Purpose:** Run multiple nodes in parallel and coordinate.
* **Example:** Search `siteA`, `siteB`, `siteC` in parallel; then call aggregator.

### Aggregator Node

* **Purpose:** Merge results from parallel nodes using a strategy (concat + dedupe, best-score, majority vote).
* **Example:** Combine `transcript`, `misinfo_flag`, `age_flag` into a single moderation decision.

### Evaluator / Scorer

* **Purpose:** Score text or outputs and optionally provide feedback to regenerate.
* **Example:** Generate 5 email drafts, evaluate each, keep the highest-scoring one.

### Tool/IO Node

* **Purpose:** Call external APIs, DBs, or trigger side-effects (send email, write to DB).
* **Caution:** Side-effect nodes should be idempotent or carefully guarded (avoid repeated sends).

### Human Input Node

* **Purpose:** Pause workflow to collect human confirmation or corrections.

# 5. Execution patterns (with tiny diagrams)

### 1) Prompt chaining (linear)

```
Input -> LLM1 -> LLM2 -> LLM3 -> Output
```

Used when large task is broken into ordered subtasks.

### 2) Routing / Decisioning

```
Input -> Router
       /    \
   PathA   PathB
```

Router chooses which path based on state or LLM decision.

### 3) Parallel + Aggregation

```
       -> LLMcall1 -\
Input -|             > Aggregator -> Output
       -> LLMcall2 -/
```

Useful for multi-angle analysis: e.g., content moderation (misinfo check, 18+ check, policy check) → aggregator merges.

### 4) Orchestration + Loops (retry/optimize)

```
Generator -> Evaluator (score)
   if score < threshold -> Generator (with feedback)
   else -> Output
```

Allows feedback loops and iterative improvement.

# 6. State: the single source of truth

* **Representation:** a dictionary-like structure: `state = { key1: value1, key2: value2 }`.
* **Accessible:** any node can read/write state at runtime.
* **Why powerful:** you can inspect the full workflow progress, debug easily, and persist partial results.

### Typical keys:

* `input.text` — original input
* `history.messages` — conversation list
* `search.results` — list of results from sites
* `moderation.flags` — array of flags

### Mutability & policies

* **Mutable state** is convenient but risky (concurrency issues). Use clear *reducers* to control updates.
* **Immutable style**: returns new copies of state for easier reasoning (but costlier).

---

# 7. Reducers — rules for updating state

Reducers answer: *when a node writes to state, how do we combine it with existing data?*

Common reducer types:

* **REPLACE:** override `state[key] = newValue`.
* **APPEND:** `state[key] = [...(state[key] || []), newValue]` (e.g., conversation history).
* **MERGE\_DEDUPE:** merge lists and remove duplicates (search results from parallel sources).
* **AGGREGATE\_STAT:** maintain min/max/sum (e.g., scores) `state.best = max(state.best, candidateScore)`.
* **CONDITIONAL UPDATE:** update only if passes validator (e.g., new summary length < limit).

Example reducer (pseudocode):

```js
function appendReducer(state, key, value) {
  state[key] = Array.isArray(state[key]) ? state[key].concat([value]) : [value];
}
```

**Parallel conflicts:** if two parallel nodes write the same key, pick a strategy:

* Use separate keys (recommended): `reviews.nodeA`, `reviews.nodeB` then aggregator merges.
* Use transactions/locks (harder).
* Use deterministic merge strategy (e.g., choose highest score).

---

# 8. Graph compilation & invocation

* **Compilation (`.compile()`)** steps:

  * Validate graph shape (missing nodes, invalid edges).
  * Detect obvious cycles (or accept and plan for loops).
  * Optimize (fuse simple nodes, plan parallel execution groups).
  * Prepare runtime plan (scheduling, timeouts, memory limits).

* **Invocation (`.invoke(initial_state)`)**:

  * Start engine with initial state and run following the compiled plan.
  * Returns final state and logs/trace for observability.

Example pseudocode:

```js
const graph = new Graph(nodes, edges);
graph.compile();
const final = await graph.invoke({ input: 'Write a short report on X' });
console.log(final.state.report);
```

---

# 9. Concrete examples (easy-to-follow)

### Example A — YouTube moderation pipeline

Nodes:

1. `transcribe_video` -> write `state.transcript`
2. parallel: `detect_misinfo`, `detect_violence`, `detect_18plus`, `policy_check`
3. `aggregator` -> combine all flags into `state.moderation_decision`
4. `action_node` -> take action (notify, demonetize, block) depending on decision

Why graph: Each check is independent and runs in parallel; aggregator makes final policy decision.

### Example B — Email draft + evaluator

1. `generate_draft` -> produce 3 drafts in `state.drafts`
2. `evaluate_each` -> score drafts -> `state.scores`
3. `aggregator` -> pick best draft
4. `send_or_suggest` -> send or ask user to confirm

Use evaluator feedback to regenerate drafts until score threshold reached.

### Example C — Search-based report

1. Orchestrator spawns `search_siteA`, `search_siteB`, `search_siteC` in parallel
2. `aggregator` merges and dedupes results -> `state.filteredResults`
3. `summarize` LLM node composes final `state.report`

# 10. Best practices & production tips

* **Make nodes as idempotent as possible.** External side effects should be guarded (e.g., send once token).
* **Use small focused nodes** (single responsibility principle).
* **Avoid parallel writes to same key**; prefer per-node keys then aggregate.
* **Observability:** Log inputs/outputs and store traces for each node.
* **Retries & backoff:** Use retry with exponential backoff for flaky nodes (APIs/LLMs).
* **Timeouts & circuit breakers:** Prevent one node from blocking whole graph.
* **Security:** Mask or avoid storing PII in shared state; encrypt sensitive keys.
* **Cost control:** Batch LLM calls or prefer cheap evaluators where possible.

---

# 11. Common pitfalls

* **Large monolithic prompts across many nodes** (costly and hard to debug). Break into smaller prompts.
* **Uncontrolled state growth** (e.g., unbounded conversation history). Use policies to truncate.
* **Non-deterministic behavior without versioning** — pin LLM models & prompt templates for reproducibility.
* **Race conditions in parallel merges** — use deterministic reducers.

---

# 12. Small cheat-sheet

* **When to route?** when different experts or models should handle different inputs.
* **When to parallelize?** when subtasks are independent and latency matters.
* **When to evaluate?** when you can cheaply score multiple candidates and pick the best.
* **Reducer choice rules:** conversation → `append`; best candidate → `max`; list-of-results → `merge_dedupe`.

---

# 13. Next steps / utilities you might want

* Visualize graph (node/edge diagram) for clarity.
* Add metrics for each node (latency, success rate, cost).
* Create a small simulation harness to run graph locally with stub LLMs.
* Write unit tests for reducers and aggregator strategies.

---

# 14. Short final note

Graph-based LLM workflows transform messy, large tasks into explicit, inspectable, and scalable systems. With careful state design and reducer policies, you can build robust agentic systems (routing, multi-agent collaboration, retries, and orchestration) that are production-ready.
