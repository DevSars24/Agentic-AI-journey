# 🚀 Agentic AI Journey with LangGraph

This repository documents my learning journey in **Agentic AI** and its implementation using **LangGraph**.
The goal is to explore how agentic systems can:

* Work **autonomously** toward user-defined goals
* Perform **planning, reasoning, and execution**
* Use **tools, memory, and supervision** effectively
* Implement workflows such as **sequential, parallel, conditional, and iterative flows**

---

## 📌 What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI is the next step in AI evolution where models move beyond passive question answering and become **active agents**. They can:

* 🎯 Take a **goal** from a user
* 🧠 Plan step-by-step strategies
* ⚡ Execute tasks via tools/APIs
* 🔄 Adapt to failures, feedback, and changing constraints
* 🧩 Maintain **short-term and long-term memory** for context

---

## 🗂️ Learning Roadmap

1. **Introduction to Agentic AI & LangGraph**

   * Difference between Generative AI and Agentic AI
   * Why LangGraph is designed for agent workflows

2. **Core Concepts of LangGraph**

   * Nodes, Edges, State
   * Graph-based workflow execution

3. **Workflows in LangGraph**

   * 🔗 Sequential Workflows
   * ⚡ Parallel Workflows
   * 🔀 Conditional Workflows
   * 🔁 Iterative Workflows

4. **Building Chatbots with LangGraph**

   * Chatbot fundamentals
   * Chatbot with Streamlit UI
   * Persistence & Time Travel
   * Streaming responses

5. **Integrations & Tools**

   * Tool usage inside LangGraph
   * Connecting with SQLite for database integration
   * Resume Chat feature (like ChatGPT)

6. **Observability & Monitoring**

   * Introduction to LangSmith
   * Observability and debugging in LangGraph

## 🧩 Five Core Components of Agentic AI

| Component            | Description                                                 |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧠 **Brain (LLM)**   | Interprets goals, plans, reasons, selects tools             |
| 🎛️ **Orchestrator** | Executes workflows (sequencing, retries, loops, delegation) |
| 🧰 **Tools**         | APIs, knowledge bases, external systems                     |
| 📝 **Memory**        | Short-term + long-term memory, state tracking               |
| 👨‍⚖️ **Supervisor** | Human-in-the-loop, guardrails, override controls            |
